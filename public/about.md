## Intro

I am a freelance software engineer who focusing on develops Apps and serves clients in the retail and travel industries. Before this, I was the co-founder & CTO of [ZHIYI](https://aiqicha.baidu.com/company_detail_67644716405156) and a Web Development Manager of [APM Monaco](https://www.apm.mc/). In my spare time, I enjoy taking interesting business ideas and combining them with technology and implementing them and sharing them on [My Github](https://github.com/vica2024). I am particularly interested in projects with high social impact. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.

## Some history

- In the spring of 1996, My cousin's uncle brought him an old computer from another place, and it was not working at that time, and I often went to my cousin's house to see the internal structure of this computer.

- When I had just graduated from elementary school and summer had just begun, my father gave me 35 yuan and told me to find a way to earn my school fees. I spent 10 yuan on a foam box and 25 yuan on wholesale ice pops and ice cream, which I sold to farmers working in the fields under the scorching sun. By the end of the summer, I had earned 2315 yuan. This is how I paid for my middle school and high school tuition, and through this experience, I discovered the wonders of business..

- At 16, I walked into an internet café for the first time and discovered the internet, the game Red Alert, and online gaming.

- 16 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter-Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, Red Alert, Halo 2, and Age of Empires II.

- At 18, I became obsessed with the online game Fantasy Westward Journey. To make my character stronger, I began learning programming. I even developed my own cheating tool, a mouse automation program. This eventually led to my game account being banned, and it was then that I truly realized that breaking the rules comes with consequences.

- At 19, I enrolled in [Guangdong Baiyun University](https://www.baiyunu.edu.cn/) in Guangzhou to study Computer Network Technology. To gain practical experience, I took a bus to the computer market in Tianhe District every weekend to assemble computers for clients, earning 50 yuan per assembly. A businessman who dealt in foreign trade once asked if I could develop a website for him. I agreed to give it a try and successfully built a foreign trade website using Dreamweaver, earning 1500 yuan. He then introduced other clients to me, and that year, three friends and I founded a web studio.

- At 20, I neglected my studies because I spent most of my time on business, and I was unfortunately expelled from school. I have never regretted this decision.

- In the spring of 2013, I founded my first software company and developed Android app that name called [睿学尖子](https://www.wandoujia.com/apps/1297867), the first learning app for middle school students in China. The app provided interactive online learning services to over 60,000 students.
